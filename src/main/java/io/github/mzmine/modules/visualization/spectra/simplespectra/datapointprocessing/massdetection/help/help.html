<h1>Mass detection</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The Mass detection module generates a list of masses (ions) for a scan.
Several algorithms are provided for this step.
The choice of the optimal algorithm depends on the raw data characteristics (mass resolution, mass precision, peak shape, noise).
In case the raw data is already centroided, only one algorithm (Centroid mass detector) can be used.
Other algorithms work only with continuous type data.
A mass detection is needed for other processing steps.
