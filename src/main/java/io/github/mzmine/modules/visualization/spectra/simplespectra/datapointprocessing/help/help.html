		<h1>Spectra Processing</h1>
        <h2>General information</h2>
        
        <p>The purpose of this module is quick automated spectra 
        processing with a defined set of modules and parameters. 
        This is similar to the batch mode for peak lists. The modules and their parameters can be 
        configured by opening a scan and pressing the "Spectra processing" button.
        Please note, that the aim of this functions is not to identify compounds by looking at a single 
        spectra. The target is to give the user a quick overview over a specific scan.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Processing queue</h3>
        <p>The processing queue is, if enabled, automatically executed sequentially from top to bottom. 
        Most modules require a mass detection to be run first.</p>
        
        <h4>Adding modules & Setting parameters</h4>
        <p>Modules can be added to the processing queue by double-clicking or pressing the "Add" button.
        Modules can be removed from the processing queue by pressing the "Remove" button.
        The parameters can be set using the "Set parameters" button or by double-clicking on a module in 
        the processing queue.</p>
        
        <h5>Displaying results</h5>
        <p>Every module has the parameters "Display results" and "Dataset color". "Display results" specifies
        if the results of a module should be displayed in the plot or just be passed to the next module.
        The results of the last module in the processing queue will be displayed regardless.
        "Dataset color" specifies a color, the results should be displayed with in the spectra plot.</p>
        
        <h6>Troubleshooting</h6>
        <dd>Nothing is happening, even though the processing is enabled.</dd>
        <dt>Check the parameters or the modules. For example, if the mass detection is set to a specific 
        noise level for one MS1 scan and the intensities vary between scans, the noise level might be too high.
        If switching between MS1 and MS2 scans, this is especially relevant.
        </dt>
