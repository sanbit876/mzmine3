                <h2>Hierarchical clustering</h2>
                <p>
                        Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters. It is either achieved using Agglomerative clustering, in which initially every point belongs to a distinct cluster and the clusters are combined with the nearest clusters iteratively; or by dividing clusters (Divisive) starting from one single cluster containing all data points, until every singe point belongs to a separate cluster. The distances between points maybe determined using e.g. Euclidean, Minkowski or Manhattan distance; and the distances between clustered maybe determined by single linkage (minimum distance between all pairs of points between the clusters), complete linkage (maximum distance between all pairs of points between clusters), and so on. Determining the number of clusters is done by setting a length to "cut" the hierarchical clustering tree, but hierarchical clustering is more commonly used as a tool for visualizing the patterns of neighbourhood.
