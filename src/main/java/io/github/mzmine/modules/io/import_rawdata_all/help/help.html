<h1>Advanced data import</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  Imports MS data files in different MS data formats in one module. Either choose files directly or
  use the buttons to list all files with a specific file format in a directory or in all sub
  directories.
</p>

<h4>Method parameters</h4>

<dl>

  <dt>File names</dt>
  <dd>List of all MS data files to be imported in different MS data formats</dd>

  <dt>Advanced import</dt>
  <dd>Apply mass detection (centroiding and thresholding) to all scans directly. CAUTION: While
    it is slightly more efficient to do this during data import, only the processed data is stored
    and the unprocessed data is discarded. Only use this method if you have tested that the final
    results are the same, compared to splitting the data import and mass detection into two separate
    steps.
  </dd>

  <dt>MS1 detector (Advanced)</dt>
  <dd>Apply mass detection (centroiding and thresholding) to all MS1 scans directly. CAUTION: While
    it is slightly more efficient to do this during data import, only the processed data is stored
    and the unprocessed data is discarded. Only use this method if you have tested that the final
    results are the same, compared to splitting the data import and mass detection into two separate
    steps.
  </dd>

  <dt>MS2 detector (Advanced)</dt>
  <dd>Apply mass detection (centroiding and thresholding) to all MS2 scans directly (all ms level>1
    scans). CAUTION: While it is slightly more efficient to do this during data import, only the
    processed data is stored and the unprocessed data is discarded. Only use this method if you have
    tested that the final results are the same, compared to splitting the data import and mass
    detection into two separate steps.
