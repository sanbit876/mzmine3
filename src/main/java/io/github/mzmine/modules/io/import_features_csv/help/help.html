  <h1>Import features from csv file format</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p> This module imports features present in a specific format from a csv file. This kind of format
    can be obtained by using xcms library in R to find peaks using Centwave algorithm on a mzXML
    file. The R code returns a list of features with following columns which can be exported to a
    csv file to be used as an import for this module. Column Numbering starts from 0, and 0th
    column is ignored. </p>
  <h4> <b>Column Name</b> - <i>Column No. </i></h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>peak_mz</b> - <i>1</i>  - peak m/z value</li>
    <li><b>mzMin</b> - <i>2</i> </li>
    <li><b>mzMax</b> - <i>3</i> </li>
    <li><b>peak_rt</b> - <i>4</i>  - peak retention time value</li>
    <li><b>rtMin</b> - <i>5</i></li>
    <li><b>rtMax</b> - <i>6</i></li>
    <li><b>maxO</b> - <i>9</i>  - intensity value </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To use this module, first input the rawdata file which was used to generate peakList from the R
    code. Then select that raw file and use csv import to import the csv file exported from the R
    code.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Example R code that generates the csv file</h4>
  mzfile <- system.file("standards.mzXML")<br>
  library(xcms)<br>
  mzraw <- readMSData(files = mzfile, mode = "onDisk")<br>
  cpw <- CentWaveParam(ppm = 15, peakwidth = c(5,20), snthresh = 10)<br>
  mzData <- findChromPeaks(object = mzraw, param = cpw)<br>
  peaklist <- as.data.frame(xcms::chromPeaks(mzData))<br>
  write.csv(peaklist, "peakListFile.csv")<br>

  </p>
